&emsp;&emsp;Do not allow yourself to become distracted by non-vital activities.
Always bear in mind the main steps of emergency action—Assess, Make Safe, Give Emergency Aid, and Get Help.

&emsp;&emsp;Your approach should be brisk (轻快的), but calm and controlled, so that you can quickly take in as much information as possible.

### TASK5:

&emsp;&emsp;Google, the Internet search-engine company, has announced it will give more than twenty-five million dollars in money and investments to help the poor.
The company says the effort involves using the power of information and technology to help people improve their lives.

&emsp;&emsp;Aleem Walji works for Google.org -- the part of the company that gives money to good causes.
He said the company’s first project will help identify where infectious (传染性的) diseases are developing.
In Southeast Asia and Africa, for example, Google.org will work with partners to strengthen early-warning systems and take action against growing health threats.

&emsp;&emsp;Google.org’s second project will invest in ways to help small and medium-sized businesses grow.
Walji says microfinance (小额信贷) is generally small, short-term loans that create few jobs.
Instead, he says Google.org wants to develop ways to bring investors and business owners together to create jobs and improve economic growth.

&emsp;&emsp;Google.org will also give money to help two climate-change programs announced earlier this year.
One of these programs studies ways to make renewable (再生的) energy less costly than coal-based energy.
The other is examining the efforts being made to increase the use of electric cars.

### TASK9:

&emsp;&emsp;In giving a business presentation, many speakers think that if their idea is strong, their audience will get it readily.
They feel discouraged when the audience is unable to understand their presentations.
That happens a lot especially when technical experts are invited to make a product presentation to a group of users.
What can we do to make a business presentation easier to understand? In my view, good presentations have always been simple and visual.
In an effective business presentation, the fewer the points, the better the message gets passed on.
You focus on the depth of coverage instead of the _width_ (广度) of coverage.
Additionally, you make your ideas visual and relevant, so the message is understood better and remembered longer.
Great business presenters relate their ideas and concepts to their audience by using simple, powerful diagrams instead of relying on text-based slides.
In fact, drawing diagrams forces a presenter to make the idea clear even at the preparation stage.
It is impossible to draw a diagram when you are not clear about an idea.

&emsp;&emsp;When your idea is clear, it is easier to transfer it.
Most audiences understand a diagram faster and remember it longer.
This possibly explains why most of the memorable presentations have been visual in nature.

1. Many speakers believe that the stronger their idea, <HideText text="C" />.

   - A. the more powerful their speech will be
   - B. the more meaningful their speech will be
   - C. the more easily the audience will understand it

2. Why are you advised to give fewer points in your presentation? <HideText text="A" />

   - A. To pass on the messages better.
   - B. To avoid wasting too much time.
   - C. To allow audience to take notes.

3. The speaker can help the audience remember the message longer by <HideText text="C" />.

   - A. displaying text-based slides
   - B. avoiding long technical terms
   - C. using simple and powerful diagrams

4. The underlined word “transfer” in this passage most probably means <HideText text="B" />.

   - A. create
   - B. pass on
   - C. take off

5. This passage is mainly about <HideText text="A" />.

   - A. how to make an effective business presentation
   - B. how to present strong ideas in a presentation
   - C. how to focus on the depth of coverage

答案：<HideText text="CACBA" />

### TASK7:

Dear Sirs,

&emsp;&emsp;I’m writing to tell you that your latest shipment(装运) of apples is not up to the standard we expected from you.
Many of them are bruised(擦伤), and more than half are covered with little spots.
They are classed as Grade A, but I think there must have been some mistake, as they are definitely not Grade A apples.

&emsp;&emsp;We have always been satisfied with the quality of your produce(农产品), which makes this case all the more puzzling.
I would be grateful if you could look into the matter.
We would be happy to keep the apples and try to sell them at a reduced price, but in that case we would obviously need a credit(部分退款) from you．
Alternatively, you could collect them and replace them with apples of the right quality.
Would you please phone me to let me know how you want to handle it?

  Yours faithfully, <br />
